GETTING STARTED
---------------

1. Connect your Spotify account

    Click the Connect Spotify button in the status bar or in the playlist tree, which will prompt you to log in to your Spotify account.

2. Control your music and playlists right from your editor

    Click on any song in your list of playlists. Music Time will prompt you to open a Spotify player—either the desktop app or web player.

    NOTE: Music Time requires a premium Spotify account and an internet connection to control your music on Windows and Linux. If you are on a Mac, Music Time can also control the Spotify desktop app using AppleScript as either a premium or non-premium user.

3. Generate your personal playlist

    Click the Generate AI Playlist button to get a personalized AI playlist generated using deep learning. Your AI Top 40 playlist is initially based on your liked songs and global developer data, but will improve as you listen to more music while you code. 

4. Try a song recommendation

    We also recommend songs by genre and mood of music based on your listening history. Try happy, energetic, or danceable music for upbeat work or classical or jazz for slower, more complex tasks. You can add a song to a playlist using the "+" button.

5. Like a song

    Like a song from the status bar by pressing the "♡" button, which helps us improve your song recommendations and adds that song to your Liked Songs playlist on Spotify.

6. Check out the Software Top 40

    Discover new music from developers around the world in a playlist generated by our algorithms. The Software Top 40 playlist is refreshed every week.
