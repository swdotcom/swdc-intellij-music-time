## It's safe, secure, and free

**We never access your code**
We do not process, send, or store your proprietary code. We only provide metrics about programming, and we make it easy to see the data we collect.

**Your data is private**
We will never share your individually identifiable data with your boss. In the future, we will roll up data into groups and teams but we will keep your data anonymized.

**Free for you, forever**
We provide 90 days of data history for free, forever. In the future, we will provide premium plans for advanced features and historical data access.
